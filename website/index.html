            <p>Halo 3 is a 2007 first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie for the Xbox 360 console. 
              The third installment in the Halo franchise, the game concludes the story arc begun in 2001's Halo: Combat Evolved and continued in 2004's Halo 2.
               Halo 3's story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the Covenant, and the alien parasite Flood. 
               The player assumes the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood. 
               The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements not present in previous titles of the series,
                as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editorâ€”a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels.</p>

          <div class="col p-3 bg-transparent text-black"><h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content.
             Definitions of music vary depending on culture, though it is an aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.
              While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions.
               The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance,
                though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. 
                Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.</p>

          <div class="col p-3 bg-dark-subtle text-black"><h2>MTB</h2>
            <p>Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes.
               Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain,
                such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes.
                 Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.</p>
